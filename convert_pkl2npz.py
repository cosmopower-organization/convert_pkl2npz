# script adapated from @dpiras: https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax/blob/main/convert_tf214.py

# script to take a .pkl file containing a trained model with CP TF<2.14, 
# and convert it to a numpy format that is readable even if the TF version is >=2.14,
# namely, avoiding pickle.
# You only need to run this once using TF<2.14 (was tested on TF=2.13), 
# and this creates the numpy file replacing the pickle file.
# After running this script you should be able to run CPJ with TF>=2.14.
# Inputs are name of the pkl file to convert, and whether pca was used or not.
# NOTE: if you want to use `filepath` with TF>=2.14, make sure you adapt this script
# so that you have the .npz dictionary in your `filepath` folder.
